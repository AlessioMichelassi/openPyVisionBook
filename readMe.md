# openPyVisionBook

Welcome to the **openPyVisionBook** repository! This project is an in-depth exploration of video processing techniques, mixing, and effects using Python, PyQt, and OpenCV. It is designed for both beginners and advanced users who are interested in the intricacies of video manipulation, and it is structured as a comprehensive book with accompanying code examples.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for the *openPyVisionBook*. The book is divided into chapters, each focusing on different aspects of video processing, from basic image manipulation to advanced mixing techniques.

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **Book Chapters**: The book is written in AsciiDoc format (.adoc), with each chapter focusing on specific topics.
- **Source Code**: Python scripts and modules that demonstrate the concepts discussed in the book chapters.
- **Data and Resources**: Includes necessary images, video files, and other assets used in the examples.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The book covers a wide range of topics, including image matrices, mixing buses, video effects, synchronization, and more.
- **Hands-On Examples**: Each chapter includes practical code examples that you can run and modify to deepen your understanding.
- **Open Source**: The entire project is open source, allowing you to explore, learn, and contribute.

## Repository Structure

- `chapters/`: Contains the book chapters in AsciiDoc (.adoc) format.
- `source_code/`: Includes all Python scripts and modules used in the book.
- `data/`: Holds image and video assets used in the examples.
- `images/`: Contains images referenced in the book.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone this repository and explore the chapters and code. The book is written in a way that allows you to follow along with the code examples, making it a hands-on learning experience.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyQt6
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pyqt6 opencv-python numpy
```
Running the Examples

Each chapter's code can be run independently. Navigate to the source_code/ directory and run the scripts as described in the respective chapters.

Example:
    
```bash
python ...youtPathC:\openPyVisionBook\openPyVisionBook\cap2\cap2_5\cap2_5_1\cap2_5_1_01.py
```
